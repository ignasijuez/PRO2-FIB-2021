# EVALUATOR: Problem Management Platform and Programming Courses

The description of the assignment is located in the 'assignment' folder (in Catalan), and the files in the 'code' folder.

## About the project

In the second semester of my first year of bachelor's degree, we had a course called Programaci√≥ 2, which continued our programming education. In this course, we delved deeper into various data structures and concepts, including stacks and queues, lists and binary trees, maps and sets, and pointers. We also focused on object-oriented programming, emphasizing classes and the integration of files within a program.

The EVALUATOR platform organizes programming problems into sessions and courses, with users tracking their progress and solving problems based on prerequisites. Each course is unique, and users can enroll, submit solutions, and receive feedback, with detailed progress statistics maintained.
